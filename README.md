# TreasureHuntAI

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The purpose of this project was to create a deep learning AI that would use Q-learning to solve a maze. The AI would first try to find it's way through the maze using exploration and then once it had enough data it would start to replay the data to learn what action to take next. Doing this recursively a few times, it would theoretically be able to find it's way through the maze. The code we were given was the python files containing the methods for how various things like the replay, action, and maze were set up and we had to actually implement the AI ourselves.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer science covers a vast area of disciplines that all focus on computation and the mathematical/technological processes that take place to facilitate computational tasks. It matters because our modern world relies upon computation a great deal as way to mitigate the increasing complexity of contempeorary life and by finding new methods to achieve these tasks we can help create solutions to pressing issues that may be impossible to tackle without computing systems.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist you must think about a problem both in terms of it's efficacy and it's efficiency. It is important to keep these both in mind since if a solution to a problem is effective but not efficient, you may not have the resource overhead to handle it properly and if a solution is efficient but not effective it may not be worth implementing. A computer scientist must balance these two in order to make a system that can both function well and function efficiently. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Our responsibilities to the organization we work for are to maintain a secure and effectively desgined system that can provide all of the useful features it needs while maintaining it's security. Our responsiblitiy to the end user is to keep their data safe and to provide them an accessible and secure enviroment in which they can use our system.
